must either be stored in byte u1 or u3 (see first 4 faces)
transparancy is probably stored in u4 (see window)
alphatest + other bits perhaps stored in u1?

u1 and u2 could be uint16
u3 and u4 could be uint16


U_SHORT CBA (CLUT position)
 bit	0-5	upper 6 bits of 10 bits VRAM CLUT X coordinate
 bit	6-14	9 bits VRAM CLUT Y coordinate
 bit 	15	unused

U_SHORT TSB (texture info)
 bit	0-4	texture page number
 bit	5-6	ABR (semitransparency method)
 bit	7-8	TPF (colour mode of the texture)
 bit	9-15	unused

ABR values (transparancy mode)
 0	50%  framebuffer + 50%  polygon
 1	100% framebuffer + 100% polygon
 2	100% framebuffer - 100% polygon
 3	100% framebuffer + 25%  polygon

TPF values (texture format)
 0	4 bit texture and CLUT
 1	8 bit texture and CLUT
 2	15 bit texture with no CLUT
